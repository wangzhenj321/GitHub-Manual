## [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

- **Headings**

    To create a heading, add number signs (`#`) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. 

- **Paragraphs**

    To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text. You should not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

- **Line Breaks**

    To create a line break (`<br>`), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

- **Emphasis**

    - **Bold**
    
        To bold text, add **two** asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
    
    - **Italic**
    
        To italicize text, add **one** asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
    
    - **Bold and Italic**
    
        To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add **three** asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

- **Blockquotes**

    To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.
    
    - **Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs**
    
        Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
    
    - **Nested Blockquotes**
    
        Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
    
    - **Blockquotes with Other Elements**
    
        Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.

- **Lists**

    - **Ordered Lists**
    
        To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.
    
    - **Unordered Lists**
    
        To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
    
    - **Adding Elements in Lists**
    
        To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab.
        
        > **Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.**

- **Code**

    To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in tick marks (`).
    
    - **Escaping Tick Marks**
    
        If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more tick marks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double tick marks (``).
    
    - **Code Blocks**
    
        To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab (or ```).

- **Horizontal Rules**

    To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (`***`), dashes (`---`), or underscores (`___`) on a line by themselves.

- **Links**

    To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses.
    
    - **Adding Titles**
    
        You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.
        
        ```
        My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
        ```
    
    - **URLs and Email Addresses**
    
        To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.
    
    - **Formatting Links**
    
        To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses.

- **Images**

    To add an image, add an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title after the URL in the parentheses.
    
    - **Linking Images**
    
        To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

- **Escaping Characters**

    To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (`\`) in front of the character.
